# Animal Classification
This project was created in collaboration with 

For this project we used [Zoo Animal Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/zoo-animal-classification) dataset.
## Description
The goal of this project is to classify different animal species in a zoo using a dataset containing various binary features that describe each animal. The classification target is the species category (e.g., mammal, bird, reptile, etc.).

The project consists of several key steps:

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Initial analysis to understand the distribution of features, relationships between them, and potential insights from the dataset.

**Clustering Approaches** – Testing agglomerative clustering and k-means clustering to observe patterns and potential natural groupings in the data.

**Supervised Classification** – Evaluating different classification models, including:
- k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)
- Nearest Prototype
- Bayesian Classifier
- Decision Tree
- 
The final evaluation compares the performance of these classifiers to determine the most effective model for classifying zoo animals based on their characteristics.
